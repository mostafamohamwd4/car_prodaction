This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed for analyzing and predicting car production data. The app provides an interactive platform where users can:

Load Data:

Upload CSV files directly.

Or load data from a local file path.

Displays dataset summary, number of rows/columns, and missing values.

Explore Data:

View dataset information, descriptive statistics, and sample rows.

Handle missing values (delete, mean, mode, fill with zero).

Statistical Analysis:

Visualize data distribution (histograms).

Analyze relationships between variables (scatter plots, box plots).

Generate correlation matrix heatmaps.

Modeling & Prediction:

Choose target and feature variables.

Train ML models:

Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso

Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Automatic data preprocessing (scaling & encoding).

Split data into training/testing.

Results & Reports:

Evaluate models with metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R².

Display prediction results (actual vs predicted).

Feature importance visualization for tree-based models.

Predict new values with user-input features.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Machine Learning Models

Streamlit (for interactive UI)
